# ace-knative-https

## 1. Have added new bar file for https
## 2. Build config altered to COPY https file rather than http
## 3. ace-echo.yaml file contains secret resource yaml containing tls certificate and key.


## Need to understand more on changes to integration-server-knative-service.yaml and to check the build files have been changed suitably.
